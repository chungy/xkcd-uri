XKCD URI Scheme
===============

Simple little thing that allows links like xkcd://927 to work.

Just made for fun, not expected to see any wide use.

Installation
------------

Put `xdg-open` somewhere in your $PATH, and `xkcd-uri.desktop` into a
location such as `$HOME/.local/share/applications`, and then run
`update-desktop-database` on that latter directory.

If it works, the command `xkcd://927` should open up your browser with
the comic of that identifier.
